# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The user has several well-designed HTML files in the root directory (home.html, cart.html, flower_catergoy.html, prodcust_detail.html) that need to be integrated into their existing Django GiftTree project. These HTML files contain modern, responsive designs with mobile-first approach and comprehensive styling that should replace or enhance the current Django templates.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the mobile-responsive features to be preserved, so that the application works well on all devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN templates are integrated THEN mobile responsiveness SHALL be maintained
2. WHEN mobile navigation is used THEN it SHALL function correctly
3. WHEN responsive breakpoints are applied THEN they SHALL work as designed
4. WHEN touch interactions are implemented THEN they SHALL remain functional
5. WHEN mobile-specific features are present THEN they SHALL be preserved
